# Individual differences in degree of discounting: Do different procedures and measures assess the same construct?

This research projects compared the two highly used, reliable procedures for measuring the discounting of delayed rewards, the Adjusting-Amount procedure and the MCQ, in samples that were more representative in both age and education.  This was published in *Behavioural Processes* in 2023.

It should be noted that the discounting model reported in the published article was fitted in Stan.  To increase accessibility, the codes presented here used R instead.  There might be minor differences in model results between the R output and the ones reported in the paper.  

The author hopes he will stick with R in the future.
